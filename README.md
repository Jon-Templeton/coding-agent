# Single Prompt - AI Coding Agent

This project implements an AI coding agent capable of autonomously building software projects based on a single user prompt. It leverages the Anthropic API to execute the entire development process, creating a fully functional project with minimal human intervention.

## Features

- Development plan creation
- Step-by-step project building using AI
- File reading, writing, and modification capabilities
- Terminal command execution for package installation and other system-level operations
- Logging of LLM history

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application
- `idea_gathering.py`: Handles the initial project idea interpretation phase
- `build.py`: Executes the development plan
- `llm_thread.py`: Manages conversations with the Anthropic Claude model
- `llm_utils.py`: Utility functions for file operations and terminal commands

## Usage

1. Create a `secret_key.txt` file in the project root and add your Anthropic API key 
2. Modify the `project_path` variable to set your desired project directory
3. Run the main script: `main.py`
4. Provide a project idea when prompted

The script will then:
1. Set up the project directory and logging
2. Connect to the Anthropic API
3. Interpret your project idea and create a development plan
4. Build the project step by step based on the AI-generated plan

## Important Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create directories and files in the specified path
- User confirmation is required before executing terminal commands or modifying files
- This tool is designed to work autonomously, with minimal user intervention after the initial prompt

## Logging

The script logs all activities in `agent_logs/agent_log.txt`. Check this file for detailed information about the build process.

## Caution

This script executes terminal commands and modifies files on your system. Always review the actions it's about to take and use it in a controlled environment. It's recommended to use this tool in a sandboxed or isolated development environment.

## Limitations

- The AI Agent's capabilities are limited by the underlying language model
- Limited to locally installable tools and packages; no web browsing capability
- Complex projects may require human intervention
- May not always produce optimal or bug-free code
